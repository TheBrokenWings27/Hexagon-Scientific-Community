             <p>The complete edition of this wide-ranging work could only be achieved by the close collaboration of a scientific book publisher and a general publisher. Series A and Bare issued by Springer-Verlag, and Series C by R. Piper Verlag.
                The scientific papers of Series A have been organized by the editors under 14 topics; for each topic we have found an internationally renowned colleague to write an annotation to Heisenberg's papers on that topic. The purpose of these introductory notes is to provide the reader a review of the origin, content and impact of these contributions. The editorial language of Series A and B is English, so that we have rendered in English the titles of the papers which Heisenberg published in German or other languages. Furthermore, we have in Series B occasionally favored the English version of a given text if it is available. Finally, all the annotations have either been written in, or translated into, English.
                The writings in Series C have also been organized into topics, not necessarily confined to a single volume. Within each topic grouping in Series A and C, and within Series B, the ordering of the papers is strictly chronological. The time sequence is determined by the date of completion or submission of the papers or manuscripts.
                The texts are as a rule given in photographic reproduction. Several publications were rearranged on the page in order to be more readable in the Collected Works; however, we have always noted the original page numbers at the margin. Some essays, especially those taken from newspapers and manuscripts, as well as the classified war reports on the reactor project, have been newly set in print.
                Editing such an extensive work could not have been accomplished without assistance from many sides. We thank the members of the Heisenberg family, especially Mrs. Elisabeth Heisenberg, for essential help in preparing the Collected Works. The documents presented to the Werner-Heisenberg-Archiv have proven to be of inesti- mable value for the practical work of the editors.
                Both publishers have, in spite of their different traditions, collaborated well with each other and the editors in their aim to present the complete Collected Works in an adequate and unified form. We would like to thank Wolf Beiglbock, Ernst Reinhard Piper, Klaus Stadler and their helpers for their fine cooperation, and especially Klaus Piper for taking the early initiative.
                David C. Cassidy, who has been working for many years on the bibliography and biography of Werner Heisenberg, has assisted us since the very beginning of the project. We would also like to thank him for his cooperation with the bibliography and the Biographical Data.
                We are indebted to the Alexander-von-Humboldt-StiJtung and the Max-Planck- Gesellschaft zur Forderung der Wissenschaften e. V. for a substantial subsidy of the publication.</p>
